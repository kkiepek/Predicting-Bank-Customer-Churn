# Project Summary/Overview
The overarching goal of our project is to leverage Machine Learning models for predicting and preventing customer churn in banks across France, Germany, and Spain. Success is defined by reducing bank churn, fostering customer retention, boosting satisfaction, and potentially driving revenue growth through retrained customers.
 
In this project, we employed three models, and the random forest model emerged with the highest accuracy during testing. The dataset reflects an overall churn rate of ~20%, signifying a substantial portion of customers at risk. According to the random forest model, the top four factors influencing churn are age, estimated salary, credit score, and balance. Notably, customers activity levels surprisingly ranks among the least impactful factors in predicting churn. This insight guides our strategy towards focusing on key determinants like age and financial metrics to effectively minimize customer churn and enhance overall banking performance.

# Predicting Customer Churn for Bank's Marketing Strategy
Customer Churn is when customers leave the bank entirely. For example, they transfer all deposits to another bank. 56% of customers who left a bank stated their decision could have been reversed. Acquiring new customers is much more costly than retaining an existing one, and most of a bank's revenue comes from existing customers. However, it is now easier than ever to change banks with the growing prevalence of online banking and mobile applications, so effective intervention strategies are imperative for reducing bank churn rates. If it is possible to predict what causes bank churn, it could be possible to target these features within marketing campaigns and promotions to keep existing customers.

# Business Understandng
# Data Understanding
We utilized a bank customer churn dataset from Kaggle, which includes banks in France, Germany, and Spain. We utilized this dataset to help banks predict when a customer would churn to allow for effective intervention and preventative actions to reduce this churn. 


# Modeling and Evaluation
Models we used: LogisticRegression, DecisionTree, RandomForest
