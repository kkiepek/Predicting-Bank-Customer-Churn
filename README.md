# Project Summary/Overview
The overarching goal of our project is to leverage Machine Learning models for predicting and preventing customer churn in banks across France, Germany, and Spain. Success is defined by reducing bank churn, fostering customer retention, boosting satisfaction, and potentially driving revenue growth through retrained customers.
 
In this project, we employed three models, and the random forest model emerged with the highest accuracy during testing. The dataset reflects an overall churn rate of ~20%, signifying a substantial portion of customers at risk. According to the random forest model, the top four factors influencing churn are age, estimated salary, credit score, and balance. Notably, customers activity levels surprisingly ranks among the least impactful factors in predicting churn. This insight guides our strategy towards focusing on key determinants like age and financial metrics to effectively minimize customer churn and enhance overall banking performance.
